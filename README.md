# SailCuresCOVID

This project, written by Rodrigue De Schatezen, Youssef Farag, and Philippe Solodov, represents our submission for the COVID-19 challenge of the CPSC 340 2020 Winter Term 2 final exam at UBC. 

This framework can train a neural network COVID classifier, given an appropriate dataset of X-Ray images. The aim of the project was to use machine learning techniques learned throughout the course (and beyond) to design an algorithm for classifying chest X-Rays with COVID-19. 

The write-up, explaining the the task and our approach, can be found in [project_report.pdf](https://github.com/Youssef-farag/SailCuresCOVID/blob/master/project_report.pdf).
The data, comprised of a train set, train labels, test set, can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VXjsmaAsx5CBn0cnhZYLe7W43hV5OWIt/view?usp=sharing
Also included in the data.zip is the our own final_predictions.csv, the predicted labels for the test set that achieved an F-score of 0.96551.
